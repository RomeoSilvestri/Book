# Pandas

Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently work with structured data, such as tabular data and time series. Pandas introduces two primary data structures, namely Series and DataFrame, which allow for easy indexing, slicing, filtering, and transformation of data. With Pandas, you can handle missing data, perform statistical calculations, apply data reshaping operations, and visualize data. It also integrates well with other libraries, such as NumPy and Matplotlib, making it a popular choice for data analysis tasks, data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
